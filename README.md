**ReadMe File: Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation with PCA and K-Means Algorithm**

### Project Title: Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation

**Overview:**
Welcome to the Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation project repository. This project employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze and segment the dynamic and expanding Electric Vehicle market. The integration of these advanced analytical techniques aims to uncover meaningful insights into consumer behaviors, preferences, and market dynamics.

**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive segmentation of the Electric Vehicle market, enabling stakeholders to tailor strategies, marketing efforts, and infrastructure development to specific consumer segments. By combining PCA for dimensionality reduction and the K-Means algorithm for unsupervised clustering, the project seeks to enhance the understanding of market structures and consumer patterns.

### Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaryan393/EV_segmentation.git
   cd EV_segmentation
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory in the specified order.



### Reports:
Refer to the `Reports` directory for detailed reports on the PCA dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering results.
